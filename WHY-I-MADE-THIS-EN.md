# 🤔 Why I Made This Prompt

Hey there. I'm Shilov. I'm 16, I live in Russia, and I write prompts for AI.

This prompt started as a joke.

I was sitting at my computer one evening, bored out of my mind, scrolling through the same old memes. Then I thought: "What if I could make AI write screenplays? Like, actually GOOD screenplays? Without all the cheesy clichés?"

I love *The Last of Us*. The first game is a masterpiece. The second... well, we don't talk about that. But the *vibe* — the gritty, grounded, survival-focused world — that's what I wanted to capture.

So I started building.

## The Problem

Most AI writing prompts are trash. They produce:
- Moralizing speeches about "the importance of family"
- Wise old mentors who die to motivate the hero
- Love triangles during the apocalypse (seriously?)
- "Humanity is the real monster" twists (we get it, it's deep)

I wanted something different. Something that felt REAL.

## The Process

I wrote the first version in a night. It was terrible.

Version 2 was better. Version 3 almost worked. Version 4.5? That's the one.

I added blocks:
- **CONSTRAINTS** — hard rules, no exceptions
- **CLICHÉ ALERT** — the prompt actually warns you if you're asking for a trope
- **ASSUMPTIONS GUARD** — the model tells you what it's assuming before it writes
- **SELF-CHECK** — silent verification before output

I tested it with Claude Opus 4.6. It worked. Really worked.

## What It Can Do

This prompt can generate:
- Full synopses
- Complex characters with flaws that actually endanger them
- 3-act structures that make sense
- Scenes with tension, subtext, and survival logic
- Dialogues where people talk like people, not themes

## What's Next

I'm just a kid with a computer and too much free time. But if this prompt helps even one writer break through their block, or helps one developer prototype a story for their game — then it was worth it.

If you use it and make something cool, let me know. If you find a bug, tell me. If you have an idea for V2.0, I'm all ears.

P.S. I'm saving my best prompts for later. This is just the beginning.
