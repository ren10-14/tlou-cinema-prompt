</user_data>

## Output (generated by Claude Opus 4.6)

[ASSUMPTIONS]:
1) Siblings: older brother (20s) and younger sister (teens)
2) Parents' location is known but far, across dangerous terrain
3) World: fungal outbreak, 5+ years in, infected common

STRUCTURE:

ACT 1 — SETUP
- Intro: Siblings LEO (24) and MAYA (16) survive in a small fortified house. Their parents left months ago to find medicine and never returned.
- Inciting Event: A trader brings word — the parents are alive, trapped in a quarantined zone 200 miles east.
- Decision: Leo wants to go. Maya insists on coming. They pack what little they have.

Key Plot Points:
- Establish sibling dynamic: Leo protective but exhausted, Maya capable but underestimated
- Show their current life: meager supplies, constant threat
- First obstacle: a gang of raiders block the main road; they detour into infected territory

TURNING POINT 1:
Maya is scratched by a runner. Not bitten — scratched — but infection is still possible. They have 24 hours to get her medicine or she turns.

ACT 2 — CONFRONTATION
- Leo pushes harder, faster. Maya weakens.
- They find an abandoned pharmacy but it's picked clean.
- They encounter another survivor group who offer help — for a price: Leo must trade his rifle.

Key Plot Points:
- The group takes them in temporarily, feeds them, shares medicine (not enough to cure, but to slow infection)
- Leo learns the group plans to trade Maya to raiders for safe passage
- Conflict: Leo must choose between trusting the group (for survival) and protecting his sister

MIDPOINT:
Leo steals back his rifle and escapes with Maya. The group gives chase. Maya's condition worsens.

TURNING POINT 2:
They reach the quarantined zone but it's overrun. No sign of parents. Only wreckage and infected.

ACT 3 — RESOLUTION
- Devastated, Leo carries Maya toward a rumored settlement — not their original goal, but the only chance.
- They're cornered by infected. Leo fights, buys time, gets wounded.
- Maya, feverish, finds a hidden bunker with medical supplies. Saves herself and Leo.

CLIMAX:
They reach the settlement. Learn the parents never made it — died weeks ago. But the settlement has walls, food, safety. They have each other.

## What This Shows
- Structure driven by survival decisions, not character arcs
- Turning points tied to practical threats (infection, raiders, supplies)
- No redemption arc, no final battle — just consequences
- Resolution is bittersweet, not happy-ending
