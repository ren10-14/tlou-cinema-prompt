# Dialogue Example — TLOU Cinema Prompt

## Input
<user_data>
Make Ren talk to Dara about whether they should cross the bridge at night
</user_data>

## Output (generated by Claude Opus 4.6)

[ASSUMPTIONS]:
1) Ren and Dara are both alive and traveling together
2) Bridge is known location, condition unknown
3) Night crossing implies danger (visibility, infected/hostiles)

EXT. BRIDGE — NIGHT

REN
We cross now or wait till morning. Hope nobody else finds this spot.

DARA
(scanning the far bank)
I count two fires on the other side. Could be traders. Could be worse.

REN
Traders don't post watch fires.

DARA
So we go around. Add two days.

REN
We don't have two days of water.

DARA
(long pause)
Then we cross fast and quiet. No lights.

## What This Shows
- Characters make decisions based on survival logic, not ideology
- Dialogue reveals information naturally (fires = danger, water shortage = time pressure)
- Subtext over exposition (we learn their situation through the conversation)
