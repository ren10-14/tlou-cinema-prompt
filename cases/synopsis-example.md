[ASSUMPTIONS]:
1) Setting: post-apocalyptic winter
2) Threats: cold, starvation, infected/hostiles
3) Group dynamics: 4-5 survivors, not all trusting each other

LOGLINE:
Five survivors cross a frozen lake toward a rumored safe zone, but when one is injured by a trap, the group fractures over whether to slow down for the wounded or leave them behind.

SYNOPSIS:

Years after the outbreak, winter has become the deadliest season. Food is scarce, infected are sluggish but still dangerous, and the cold kills as surely as any bite.

A group of five — MARA (30), her younger brother JACE (19), a taciturn hunter named VELL (50), a pregnant woman named SYL (28), and an injured stranger they found named COLE (35) — learn of a settlement on the far side of a vast frozen lake. Rumors say it has walls, food, and medicine. The lake is their only chance.

The crossing begins well. The ice holds. The group moves fast. But on the second day, Cole steps into a bear trap hidden under snow. His leg is shattered. He can't walk.

The group faces a choice: carry him and slow to a crawl, risking the ice melting or infected catching up — or leave him behind to die.

Mara, who convinced the group to take Cole in, refuses to abandon him. Vell, practical and harsh, argues that one life isn't worth five. Syl stays silent, torn between her own survival and her conscience. Jace follows his sister's lead.

As they argue, the wind shifts. From the shore behind them — howls. Not infected. Wolves. Hungry, desperate wolves.

Now the choice is no longer theoretical. They have minutes to decide.

Spoiler: The group splinters. Vell and Syl (carrying the future) press on alone. Mara, Jace, and Cole take a different route, slower, more dangerous. Both groups face their own trials — wolves, thin ice, starvation — and both lose members. By spring, only two survivors reach opposite shores. Neither knows if the other made it.

## What This Shows
- Every plot point serves survival (no romance, no ideological debates)
- Moral dilemmas emerge from practical constraints (food, speed, ice)
- Ending is ambiguous — no miracle cure, no safe zone revealed
- Characters defined by choices under pressure
