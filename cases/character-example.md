## Output (generated by Claude Opus 4.6)

[ASSUMPTIONS]:
1) The world fell 10+ years ago
2) Infected are present but not the only threat
3) Scavenging is a common way to survive

CHARACTER: KORIN
Age: 17

Appearance: Wiry build, dark hair cropped short. A scar runs across her left cheek from shrapnel. She wears a modified gas mask on a cord around her neck and carries a crowbar as both tool and weapon.

Backstory: Born just before the outbreak, Korin never knew the old world. Her brother, the only family she remembered, died three years ago when their shelter collapsed during a blight. She's been alone since, moving between abandoned settlements, trusting no one.

Motivation: Find a rumored settlement where people don't starve — somewhere with walls, crops, and safety.

Flaw: Trusts no one. She'll leave others behind without hesitation, even when joining a group could improve her chances.

Role in group: Lone wolf. Initially hostile or indifferent to any group, she must be convinced that cooperation is worth the risk.

## What This Shows
- Character serves the survival narrative (no romance subplot)
- Flaw directly endangers them (distrust prevents cooperation)
- Motivation is concrete and survival-based (food, safety)
- Backstory explains behavior without moralizing
