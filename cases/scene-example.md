INT. ABANDONED MALL — DAY

Dust motes dance in shafts of light from broken skylights. Overturned benches, shattered glass, faded store signs. A figure moves through the debris, methodical, quiet.

The figure — a woman, mid-thirties, lean, with a crowbar in her hand — picks through the remains of a electronics store. Pushes aside empty shelves. Finds nothing.

She stops. Listens.

Distant sound — metal scraping concrete. Footsteps, more than one. Coming closer.

She melts into the shadows behind a pillar. Presses herself against the concrete. Breathes slow.

Two men enter the mall. Rifles up. One points toward the electronics store.

MAN #1
Fresh tracks. In the dust.

MAN #2
(nods)
Fan out. Check the stores.

The woman waits until they pass. Then she moves, silent as smoke, toward the emergency exit at the far end.

A floorboard creaks under her boot.

MAN #1
(whirling around)
Hey! Freeze!

The woman bolts. Gunfire erupts. Bullets spark off metal, shatter glass.

She crashes through the emergency exit door into blinding sunlight. Runs. Doesn't look back.

## What This Shows
- Cold open establishes tone without committing to characters
- Visual details create atmosphere (dust, light, debris)
- Action reveals character (methodical, quiet, experienced)
- Tension through sound and pacing
- Survival logic: when outnumbered, run
